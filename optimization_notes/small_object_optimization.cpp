/**
 * NOTES:
 * 1. void* void* is a pointer type that can hold the address of any type of object, making it a "generic" pointer. 
 * It is often used in low-level programming for situations where the exact type of the data being pointed to is
 * not known at compile time.
 * Use Cases for void*:

    1. Generic Pointers: void* allows you to create pointers that are not type-specific. For example:

    int x = 42;
    void* ptr = &x; // ptr can point to any type

    2. Interfacing with C Libraries: Many C APIs (e.g., malloc and free) use void* to work with data of any type. For example:

    int* arr = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // malloc returns void*
    free(arr);

    Passing Raw Memory: It is useful when passing raw memory or generic objects, such as in custom memory allocators.
 * Important Characteristics of void*:

    Cannot Be Dereferenced Directly: Since void* does not point to a specific type, dereferencing it is not allowed because
    the compiler does not know the size or type of the object being pointed to.
    ~
    void* ptr = &x;
    std::cout << *ptr; // Error! Cannot dereference void*
    ~
    To dereference, you must cast it to the appropriate pointer type:
    ~
    void* ptr = &x;
    std::cout << *(int*)ptr; // Cast to int* before dereferencing
    ~
    
    Cannot Perform Pointer Arithmetic: Pointer arithmetic (e.g., ptr++, ptr + 1) requires knowledge of the data type's size, which is not possible with void*.
    Size and Alignment Are Not Defined: A void* pointer can hold the address of any type, but the size of the object being pointed to is unknown.
